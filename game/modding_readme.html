                                <p>Modding support is one of the priorities in Bloodworks. Game engine is written in C++ for performance (and me being more familiar) reasons but the game content mostly runs on Lua side. Each moddable game object (Guns, monsters, missions etc) is loaded using a json file (which initializes some static variables related to object).</p>
                                <p>Lets start with an example:</p>
                                <h3>
                                    Simple Example : Pistol
                                </h3>

                                <div class="panel">
                                    Each game entity template has a json file that defines the template. The first thing game does is searching for all json files under resources folder and interpreting/loading them one by one. Pistol is defined under "resources/guns/pistol/data.json".
                                    <button class="accordion">Expand</button>
                                    <div class="panel">

                                    <p>Each json file must has an entry named "type" which represents the type of the entity template that is being loaded. In this case we are loading a gun. All other entries in this example are specific to a gun. For example first two entries (name and icon) is used for displaying the gun on various GUI elements. And after that we have a bunch of stuff that makes this gun different than others.</p>
                                    <p>One of the most important entries here are scriptFile and scriptName. scriptFile is path to lua script that contains the trigers for this gun and scriptName is the name of the lua object that contains trigers for our gun. Once the engine sees the entry "scriptFile", it will load the lua script and it will link the gun on c++ side to scriptTable that has been just loaded. Let's see what is inside pistol.lua.</p>

                                    <p>An here we have a bunch of trigers that has been attached to "Pistol" (which is scriptName that is defined in json). We have init and onTick trigers for our gun. Notice that each triger has a parameter named "gun". This is the lua object that the trigers should use to change or get state of the gun.</p>
                                    <p>As the name suggests, init is the triger that is called once (per mission) which is basically initializes the gun. ShootTimer and SpreadHelper are two helper objects that is used in guns (their sources are in resources/guns/helpers.lua). ShootTimer basically sets the minimum interval between each firing of gun and SpreadHelper is used creating a dynamic spread (which gets larger as you fire the gun and lower as it gets cooldown). Here we set a 0.35 second delay between shoots (so ~3 shoots per second) and initialize some variables for our gun's spread.</p>
                                    <p>Notice that the parameters that SpreadHelper are stored inside gun.data. Each gun (and other game entities) has a lua table named "data" in their lua objects. This table can be used for storing any custom variable the gun needs. SpreadHelper has a bunch of variables it initilizes on "data" and we are customizing these variables after the initialization. In this example we are setting min and max spread to 0 and 0.1 (which are angles in radian, so Pistol has 0 degree spread when it is perfectly cooled down and 18 degree spread once you fire your pistol a bunch of times). After setting min and max spread, it sets the spread decrease rate as time goes on (spreadDecreaseSpeed, gun reduces spread by 0.25 per second) and how larger the spread gets after every shoot (spreadIncreasePerShoot, 0.02 radian per shoot)</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Next triger in for our gun is onTick. As the name suggests, this one is called on every game tick.</p>
                                    <p>First thing the gun does here is ticking the spread, which is a helper function on SpreadHelper that cooldowns the gun and reduces its spread. After that we have an if statement <code>gun.isTriggered and gun:hasAmmo()</code></p>
                                    <p>Remember that I said the trigers access the gun's state using the parameter named "gun"? This is an example. Here we are checking if gun is trigered (ie. player wants to shoot it) and we call a function to check if we have enough to fire. If both of those are true, we want to create a bullet for our gun. But wait, we also have a ShootTimer to control our shooting rate of the gun. <code>ShootTimer.checkGun</code> checks if the gun ready and returns true if it is.</p>
                                    <p>If all those conditions are true, we can create a new bullet for our gun. We already defined our bullet details in json file so they are not necessarry to define here (allthough we can override them here if we want.). First, the triger calls <code>gun:consumeAmmo()</code> to remove one bullet from our gun. (We also defined number of bullets per clip and reloading duration, so gun will be reloaded when we use last bullet and <code>gun:hasAmmo()</code> will return false until it is done).</p>
                                    <p>And in our next statement, finally we create a bullet for our gun! All bullet details are given in the json. But here we want to customize our bullet a little by adding a trail particle to it. <code>gun:addBullet()</code> returns a bullet object so we can change the state of the bullet. Here we set this object to local variable named "bullet" and call addTrailParticle function to attach a particle effect to this bullet. "BulletTrailParticle" is name of the particle effect we want to attach and it is defined in some other json file (and controlled by lua & shader files). We pass some arguments to addTrailParticle (first one defines local shift for particle position and second one is distance between each particle that will be created as bullet moves, last one (empty table) is a parameter that is sent to particle's lua script) and tweak the particle that the function returns.</p>
                                    <p>That is all for our simples gun!</p>

                                </h2>
                                <p>Game loop of Bloodworks runs on C++ side. In this part it renders stuff, does player controls, ticks monsters, guns, calls necessarry trigers etc etc. On lua side, we have scriptTables that contains trigers for game entities. For each instance of object (monster/gun etc) we have a lua object with some variables and methods to link it to its c++ counterpart and we have a scriptTable to contain all trigers for this object's template.</p>
                                <p>Other than these objects and scriptTables, we have a bunch of public methods on lua side to alter game/mission state or get some useful information about our current state. For example "addCustomBullet" adds a bullet that is not linked to any gun. "getMonsterCount" returns number of monsters. There are quite a few function like that and they will be further explained.</p>
                                <p>Pretty much everything that can be accessible by lua side are defined in BloodworksLuaWorld.cpp. I will try to explain things here but check that file if you want a more complete list</p>

After doing that it will ask you to enter path for a mod to upload. This is a relative path to executable folder so if your path folder is named 'my_awesome_gun', just enter 'resources/mods/my_awesome_gun'. After that your mod should be uploaded to server and other players will be able to access it. If you want to edit your mod, just reupload it.</p>
